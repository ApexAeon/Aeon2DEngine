# Aeon 2D Game Engine
## Programmed in Python using PyGame.
I want to be a game developer one day, 
and this project is my first step 
towards being able to make a lot of 
games for free. This project is based
off of another project that I created
and have not finished yet, a game
called Cataclysm. Anyway, this engine
is meant to be a simple, 2D game
engine capable of doing isometric
games, top-down style games, and
eventually, platformers/sidescrollers
in an easy to program way.
I just want to make a tool for
myself and maybe others to make 
games, so I decided to make this
engine. The engine has a menu system,
saving and loading (which doesn't
quite work yet), a character that
moves around naturally and coasts to
a stop
### Using my engine.
You can make a game with my engine 
if you want I guess? Just ask me 
first and make sure to give credit 
to me. I don't know why you would
want to use this, or how you would
know how or be able to.
